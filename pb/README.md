# Protobufs

It's all in one file due to the way protoc-gen-firebase_rules is implemented.

The included binary is for MacOS x86_64 (amd64 through Rosetta works too). For some reason they only prebuilt for MacOS. 
If you need to build for another platform, you'll have to build it using Bazel. You can find it [here](https://github.com/FirebaseExtended/protobuf-rules-gen).
